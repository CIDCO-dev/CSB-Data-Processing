Reactive applications are message-driven, elastic, responsive, and resilient. Common traits of reactive applications include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/event-driven"&gt;event-driven architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Data integration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Distributed integration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Events&lt;/em&gt; play a major role in these types of applications. Events are not new, but event-driven architectures are gaining in popularity and use asynchronous message queue technologies such as RabbitMQ, Apache ActiveMQ, WebLogic, and IBM MQ. In this article, you'll learn how &lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/"&gt;Apache Camel K&lt;/a&gt; can make it easier to develop reactive applications on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; by integrating data sources, &lt;a href="https://kafka.apache.org"&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt; brokers, and &lt;a href="https://knative.dev/docs/"&gt;Knative&lt;/a&gt; for event management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why choose Camel K?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apache Camel K is a Kubernetes-native cloud integration platform based on &lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org"&gt;Apache Camel&lt;/a&gt;. Apache Camel is popularly known as the Swiss army knife of integration. Camel 2.x can integrate a wide range of endpoints, transform data into and out of different formats, and process data using prebuilt enterprise integration patterns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The release of Camel 3 in 2019 introduced Camel K. This framework creates integrated, modular, lean, and fast applications and functions that are inherently reactive. Such applications and functions can run serverless on Kubernetes or &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/openshift"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt; clusters. The cluster can be hosted on a public, private, or hybrid cloud or using on-premises infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Camel K combines the well-known Camel components and connectors with the low boot times and memory consumption of the &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/overview"&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/java"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; platform. Quarkus gives programmers built-in tools for making applications that are based on message forwarding and are responsive, elastic, and resilient. To interact with many types of systems, Quarkus offers these capabilities through extensions. Each new release of Quarkus adds more extensions, enabling more reactive features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How Camel K enables reactive applications&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To build a reactive application, an integration specifies the sources and destinations (sinks) of interactions. This configuration is referred to as &lt;em&gt;binding&lt;/em&gt; in the Camel K universe. Camel K introduces the concept of &lt;em&gt;Kamelets,&lt;/em&gt; which configure both sources and sinks. So to build a reactive application, you just need to connect a source Kamelet to a sink Kamelet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an example, imagine an e-commerce website that dynamically updates its masthead banner in real time with information on the ten fastest selling items. The application accomplishes this task through a &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/microservices"&gt;microservices&lt;/a&gt;-based architecture with Kafka topics as the communication medium. The application couples the Kafka topic listing customer orders to an Infinispan cache that stores the names of the sold items. The web application then fetches information on sales from the Infinispan cache and updates the masthead in the client browser over WebSockets. Figure 1 shows the elements of this solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-center" role="group"&gt;&lt;div class="rhd-c-figure"&gt; &lt;article class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-article-content-full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="field field--name-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__items"&gt; &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/ecom.png" data-featherlight="image"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width_1440px_w/public/ecom.png?itok=wc1vFTef" width="1440" height="677" alt="A basic architecture for real-time, reactive updates to a web page uses Kafka, connected through Camel K." typeof="Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="field field--name-field-caption field--type-string field--label-hidden field__items"&gt; &lt;div class="rhd-c-caption field__item"&gt; Figure 1: A basic architecture for real-time, reactive updates to a web page uses Kafka. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption class="rhd-c-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache Kafka is one of the most widely used platforms for event streaming. Traditionally, however, applications would have to be Kafka-integration aware and would have to orchestrate data to flow it into Kafka clusters. Alternatively, the applications would use Debezium connectors. Camel K hides the details of Kafka messaging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another valuable feature of Camel K is the &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; Kamelet, which can be illustrated through two new business demands in our example application. Suppose that an item can be listed as one of the top selling items only when the price exceeds $1,000. Additionally, to prevent unintentional disclosure of credit card numbers recorded in messages listing customer orders, the application must mask the credit card field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An action Kamelet carries out specific activities on messages passed in by a source Kamelet. To satisfy our two new business demands, the developers create an action Kamelet that filters entries based on the price field and hides the credit card field. Figure 2 illustrates the new architecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-center" role="group"&gt;&lt;div class="rhd-c-figure"&gt; &lt;article class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-article-content-full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="field field--name-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__items"&gt; &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/act.png" data-featherlight="image"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width_1440px_w/public/act.png?itok=sCkPel9K" width="1440" height="864" alt="The application adds a Camel K action to filter information before it goes to the web page." typeof="Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="field field--name-field-caption field--type-string field--label-hidden field__items"&gt; &lt;div class="rhd-c-caption field__item"&gt; Figure 2: The application adds a Camel K action to filter information before it goes to the web page. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption class="rhd-c-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going serverless with KNative&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Businesses are highly conscious of the costs associated with running applications in the cloud and want to get the most out of their cloud investments. A &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/serverless-architecture"&gt;serverless&lt;/a&gt; computing option is one way that cloud providers today offer even more cost savings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Camel K, in conjunction with Knative, provides reactive applications that can be automatically instantiated on source triggers and that scale to zero when no traffic is present. Furthermore, such serverless functionality is available on any cloud that can host a vanilla Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to add the following added business requirements to our sample application:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the price of an item is higher than $4,000, an email message must be sent to the purchaser for confirmation purposes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Since the entire solution is reactive, the business wants to minimize compute costs caused by idle polling during periods of no activity or traffic.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows a possible architecture that meets these requirements. A notable change is the use of Knative channels that decouple the source Kamelet (the Kafka topic) from the action and sink Kamelets (the Infinispan cache and email server).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-center" role="group"&gt;&lt;div class="rhd-c-figure"&gt; &lt;article class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-article-content-full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="field field--name-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__items"&gt; &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/dec.png" data-featherlight="image"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://developers.redhat.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width_1440px_w/public/dec.png?itok=l7LCEEQt" width="1440" height="707" alt="The application adds Knative to manage messages." typeof="Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="field field--name-field-caption field--type-string field--label-hidden field__items"&gt; &lt;div class="rhd-c-caption field__item"&gt; Figure 3: The application adds Knative to manage messages. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption class="rhd-c-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Camel K and Knative&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solutions illustrated by this article have the following advantages over older server technologies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability:&lt;/strong&gt; Camel K is a Kubernetes-native runtime, so applications can be managed as Kubernetes objects. Applications behave consistently across any platform, both in the cloud and on-premises, wherever Kubernetes or OpenShift is running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open source with no lock-in:&lt;/strong&gt; With active contributions from the community and enterprise open source companies such as Red Hat, new and innovative features are always being added and upgraded to Camel, with no vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Camel is one of the most famous integration frameworks, with industry-tested and established connectors. Camel K makes it possible for you to further modernize your application while still enjoying Camel's reliability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High return on investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Camel K helps you create integrated applications and event-driven, reactive applications and also go serverless with your enterprise processes. This all takes place within a single framework and leaves room for more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learn more about Camel K and Knative&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following documentation and web sites offer more background on the technologies discussed in this article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/next/"&gt;Apache Camel K project website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://knative.dev/docs/"&gt;Knative project website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_integration/2022.q3/html/getting_started_with_camel_k/index"&gt;Getting started with Red Hat Camel K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/0.9.x/index.html"&gt;Community Kamelet catalog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_integration/2022.q3/html/kamelets_reference/index"&gt;Red Hat Kamelet catalog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://redhat-developer-demos.github.io/knative-tutorial/knative-tutorial/index.html"&gt;Knative and Camel K tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/learn/camel-k"&gt;Red Hat learning path: Develop with Camel K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; The post &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/11/07/build-reactive-apps-kubernetes-using-camel-k" title="Build reactive apps on Kubernetes using Camel K"&gt;Build reactive apps on Kubernetes using Camel K&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog" title="Red Hat Developer"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary><dc:creator>Sumit Mukherjee</dc:creator><dc:date>2022-11-07T07:00:00Z</dc:date></entry><entry><title>Intros, deep dives, and announcements: Our best of October 2022</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/11/04/intros-deep-dives-and-announcements-our-best-october-2022" /><author><name>Heiker Medina</name></author><id>35a5fa3e-a047-464f-890a-c2fc334a3f87</id><updated>2022-11-04T07:00:00Z</updated><published>2022-11-04T07:00:00Z</published><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've gathered up the most popular content from Red Hat Developer for October 2022, and we hope you find it informative and helpful. We've divided them into product announcements, topic roundups, learning guides, and advanced deep dives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Get started with product announcements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/24/red-hat-joins-backstageio-community"&gt;Red Hat is joining the Backstage.io community&lt;/a&gt; to improve the developer experience on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;. In this announcement, Serena Chechile Nichols describes how OpenShift and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; are critical to Red Hat's customers, and how Red Hat aims to provide tools that make it easier and more productive for teams to build services and applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At KubeCon North America 2022, Stevan Le Meur and Tim deBoer highlighted how the Podman community &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/24/podman-expands-desktop"&gt;unveiled and introduced Podman Desktop&lt;/a&gt;. This convenient GUI enables users to interact with containers and pods running in Podman. Podman Desktop also provides easy deployment to Kubernetes for developers working with containers on their laptops, allowing a seamless transition from containers to pods and pods to Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the upcoming release of macOS Ventura, the Apple Virtualization Framework will get new features that make it easy to &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/21/rhel-9-and-single-node-openshift-vms-macos-ventura"&gt;run ARM Linux virtual machines natively&lt;/a&gt; on the M1 processor or other Apple silicon chips. Michael Hrivnak and Benjamin Schmaus describe the new features, including an EFI bootloader and the ability to render the desktop GUI in a window. Red Hat recently took a look at how easy it would be to run virtualized versions of two key technologies—Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and the single node version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform—on Apple silicon. Spoiler alert: it was successful!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Topic-specific round-up articles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for content on continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), Red Hat Developer has you covered. We've collected &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/20/ultimate-cicd-resource-guide"&gt;the best articles about this topic from the past year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a separate article, Fernando Lozano discusses &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/06/kubernetes-storage-concepts"&gt;Kubernetes storage concepts&lt;/a&gt;, including volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. Lozano explains why these concepts matter to developers, as well as how they enable system administrators to manage storage for a cluster while offering developers self-service to storage. Lozano also teaches about stateful sets' special abilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Start with the basics, and grow from there&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vamsi Ravula and Hugo Guerrero explain &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/06/how-make-your-apis-more-discoverable"&gt;how making APIs discoverable is a key part of any API management initiative&lt;/a&gt;. If an API isn't easily found and discovered, teams will end up building their own. That leads to duplication of efforts and underutilization of existing APIs, or users trying to contact the developer every time someone wants to use the API—an unsustainable practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an earlier article, Bob Reselman described &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/04/how-does-rpm-package-discovery-work"&gt;how RPM package discovery works&lt;/a&gt;, digging into the role of the .repo files in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory on your local machine in discovering and installing RPM packages. Last month, he went to the next level of detail to &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/07/whats-inside-rpm-repo-file"&gt;describe the format specified for a .repo file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vamsi Ravula examines &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/20/10-essentials-mitigating-api-security-risks"&gt;ten essential solutions and tools for building a more secure API&lt;/a&gt;. Learn the best way to mitigate security risks from the start of the development process through each step in the API life cycle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don't be scared to pull out the big guns: Try a harder lesson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should also check out Bob Reselman's &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/05/filter-content-html-using-regular-expressions-grep"&gt;latest article in a series on using grep&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux command that filters content in files or as output from stdout. The previous articles in the series discussed metacharacters and regular characters, quantifiers, pattern collections, groups, and word boundaries in regular expressions. This article uses all of those features plus new ones to match and filter HTML content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reselman then moves on to discuss &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/13/advanced-regex-capture-groups-lookaheads-and-lookbehinds"&gt;capturing groups, lookaheads, and lookbehinds&lt;/a&gt; to give you a powerful way to extract information from text with regular expressions. This article explains the syntax you need to know in order to write them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third and final article in his series about &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/06/csi-drivers-essential-kubernetes-storage"&gt;Kubernetes storage concepts&lt;/a&gt;, Fernando Lozano shows you how Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers enable advanced storage features that are necessary for production environments and CI/CD pipelines. This article also underscores the need for storage products designed specifically for Kubernetes versus those designed for traditional physical and virtual data centers or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

This large open source project is the basis for many backend web applications and offers lessons for other open source communities. This article discusses the project's goals and progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why open source planning is difficult&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many open source projects find it difficult to plan upgrades and set roadmaps because nobody is in charge of telling people what to do. The collaborative process can be a difficult mind shift for people coming from teams that have done internal development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roadmaps are easier for projects sponsored mainly by a single organization. Although the single organization project is open, a lead from that organization can more easily influence the direction of the work. The same is true for projects with a single contributor because they can set a roadmap based on their commitment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Node.js project is not in that easy position. In this large project, managed by its community through a  &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, no single person or organization provides enough resources to set a fixed roadmap. Still, we must determine what is necessary to accomplish goals and ensure the project's future success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gathering opinions from the expert community&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Next-10 effort &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/797"&gt;kicked off in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; to make the second ten years of Node.js even more successful than the first ten. Initial discussions quickly revealed that we needed to document the foundations for discussing, documenting, and enabling the work required for future success. As a result, we wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/technical-values.md"&gt;project's technical values&lt;/a&gt;: The fundamental criteria we should use to assess tradeoffs and priorities. The success of the first then years can be credited to a set of core values. Documenting and evolving these values would be critical to continued success.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/blob/main/CONSTITUENCIES.md"&gt;project's constituencies&lt;/a&gt;: Having a clear idea of our stakeholders helps us prioritize the features and changes made in the project.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/blob/main/CONSTITUENCY-NEEDS.md"&gt;needs of the project's constituencies&lt;/a&gt;: Understanding the needs of different constituencies helps us assess which work will benefit the broadest range of constituencies and ensure we are addressing all of the constituencies sufficiently.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created these documents through a process that included the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brainstorming within the Next-10 team.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Input from Node.js core collaborators.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A broader &lt;a href="https://nodejs.medium.com/next-10-years-of-node-js-understanding-the-needs-of-the-node-js-constituencies-2f95a1df6a6f"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; to get feedback from our ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this input process, we were ready to capture the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/technical-priorities.md"&gt;top technical priorities&lt;/a&gt; that we felt were important to the project's future success. A summary of these priorities (in no particular order) includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modern HTTP&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Suitable types for end-users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ESM&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Features from the latest ECMAScript specification&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Observability&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A security model for permissions and policies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Better multithreaded support&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Single executable applications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We generated this list by brainstorming in Next-10 meetings and received broader input from the Node.js collaborator base. Since then, we have worked on each priority to dive deep and define concrete steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, no single person or organization can direct collaborators to work on a technical priority, but it is vital to enable volunteers who want to work on them. A well-defined set of priorities, and an agreement about what we need to do for each priority, can help collaborators feel empowered to jump in and help out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Next-10 team's progress&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the Next-10 team has led deep dives on most of the technical priorities and has documented the way forward. We documented the agreements on what was important in the project's &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/"&gt;contributing documents&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of the documents include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/maintaining-types-for-nodejs.md"&gt;Maintaining types for Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/security-model-strategy.md"&gt;Security Model &lt;/a&gt;S&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/security-model-strategy.md"&gt;trategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/maintaining-http.md"&gt;Maintaining HTTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/maintaining-web-assembly.md"&gt;Maintaining Web Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep dives also helped to drive discussion and critical mass to kickstart initiatives, which included:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#fetch"&gt;Experimental support for fetch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/single-executable"&gt;Single executable applications team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very grateful to those who participated in the mini-summits, where we held the deep dives (refer to the files that begin with "summit" &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/tree/main/meetings"&gt;in the meeting minutes&lt;/a&gt;). It was great to bring together people from within and outside the project with relevant expertise and opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found that the summits were all great learning and collaborative experiences. They helped me understand and prioritize where the Red Hat team needs to contribute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/blob/main/TECHNICAL_PRIORITY_WORKING_SUMMARY.md"&gt;Technical Priority Working Summary&lt;/a&gt; captures a high-level overview of the technical priorities and next steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, where are we now? We have a good set of technical priorities and defined concrete work for most of them. As always, more volunteers are welcome to help move these forward. We plan to revalidate the foundation's technical values, project constituencies, needs, and technical priorities. This process will be ongoing to ensure we adjust as the environment and our requirements change over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We plan to start the revalidation process in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues/333"&gt;session&lt;/a&gt; led by Jean Burellier, Ruy Adonrno, and myself at the &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2020/openjs-world/features/openjs-collaborator-summit/"&gt;Collaborator summit&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin in October. If you have a passion for Node.js, a great way to help out is to contribute to our Next-10 discussion and make sure we get this right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Community outreach and documentation are keys to success&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planning is essential to the success of open source projects. Planning is not about directing project resources to tasks but building agreement on direction and empowering volunteers to make progress on that agreement. We hope to inspire other projects by explaining our process of gathering information from our constituencies and recording everything to mark agreement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope that sharing our planning process in the Node.js project has been interesting and might even give you some ideas about how to do the same in your projects. On the flip side, I am always interested in learning new methods. So let us know if you have found a great way to handle your project planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/nodejs"&gt;Node.js topic page&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date with what Red Hat is up to on the Node.js front.&lt;/p&gt; The post &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/11/03/how-next-10-project-supports-future-nodejs" title="How the Next-10 project supports the future of Node.js"&gt;How the Next-10 project supports the future of Node.js&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog" title="Red Hat Developer"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary><dc:creator>Michael Dawson</dc:creator><dc:date>2022-11-03T07:00:00Z</dc:date></entry><entry><title type="html">20k+ active users of BPMN VS Code Extension</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/11/20k-active-users-of-bpmn-vs-code-extension.html" /><author><name>Eder Ignatowicz</name></author><id>https://blog.kie.org/2022/11/20k-active-users-of-bpmn-vs-code-extension.html</id><updated>2022-11-02T05:00:00Z</updated><content type="html">Last month, we reached an important milestone for our community: 20k+ active users for our BPMN VS Code Extension. It has been a long road since our first prototype in . After several releases and incremental iterations, we are proud to develop the most popular for VS Code. Under the hood, the BPMN editor is based on Stunner. Stunner is a library for building web applications that provide visualization and authoring capabilities for representing knowledge domains. Soon, Roger will write a series of blog posts that deep dive into how Stunner works behind the scenes.

This process is called integration. Typical subsystems include databases and web services. This article explains how &lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org"&gt;Apache Camel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; support easy integration of such services through &lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.10.x/kamelets/kamelets-user.html"&gt;Kamelets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How Kamelets make Camel integration easy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apache Camel is a popular open source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs). Camel is a complete, production-ready framework with a built-in set of patterns you can use in your integration flows. These patterns are based on design patterns and help connect different systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers build many frameworks on Apache Camel. This article focuses on &lt;a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/"&gt;Camel K&lt;/a&gt;, but several other frameworks exist, such as Camel Kafka and Camel Quarkus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Camel K is a lightweight integration framework based on Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes to create serverless and microservice architectures. Camel K allows you to write configuration instructions in the YAML format. The YAML file is known as a Kamelet. Any Kubernetes cluster can deploy a Kamelet as a resource.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of a simple Kamelet follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt;apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1 kind: KameletBinding metadata: name: integration spec: source: ref: apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1 name: aws-ddb-streams-source kind: Kamelet sink: ref: apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1 name: pulsar-sink kind: Kamelet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kamelets make it easy to exploit the power of Camel K without previous knowledge of that tool. Kamelets are integration snippets with connectors, in the form of sources and sinks, that allow you to connect to external systems using a simplified interface that hides the details of a connection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4 Advantages of Kamelets&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers are turning to Kamelets for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kamelets simplify and streamline the integration of services into Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can employ Camel's powerful integration through a Kamelet without any prior knowledge of Camel.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Kamelets offer connectors for &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/event-driven"&gt;event-driven applications&lt;/a&gt;. Events are becoming increasingly important, particularly with microservices. As event-driven applications spread, many organizations and developers have begun to use &lt;a href="https://kafka.apache.org"&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://knative.dev/docs/"&gt;Knative&lt;/a&gt; as the backbone for connecting all of the systems' applications.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Kamelets make it easy to reuse code for different use cases.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3 Types of Kamelets&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kamelets are classified into three types:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Source: Consumes data from an external system into your platform.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sink: Sends data to an external system or performs an action on the data.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Action: Performs an intermediate step: For example, an action can convert an event to a PDF file before it is saved to a sink.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use a sink or a source to listen to or trigger several types of events, like a channel or a broker. For example, a Kafka channel can be directly connected to a JMS broker using Kamelets. In another example, the Aws-ddb-streams-source can take data from an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/"&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt; database, and the &lt;a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/io-overview/"&gt;pulsar-sink&lt;/a&gt; sink could then store this data elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Advanced features of Kamelets&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;KameletBindings provide a source and a sink as a pair.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can store Kamelets in a catalog, similar to a GitHub repository. &lt;a href="https://github.com/KaotoIO/kaoto-ui"&gt;Kaoto&lt;/a&gt; is a catalog provided by my team. Kaoto is a free, open-source tool that provides a simple integration framework based on Apache Camel, making it easier to visualize your integrations and create Kamelets.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kamelets advanced features make it easy to utilize Camel K. You can connect to external systems using a simplified interface that hides connection details. There are many advantages to using Kamelets for application integration.

If you are still using the WildFly distribution we highly encourage migrating to the Quarkus distribution as soon as possible, see the for more details. NEW KEYCLOAK OPERATOR UPGRADE We are happy to announce that the new Keycloak Operator for the Quarkus based distribution is no longer a preview feature. We added new functionality as well as a number of improvements, some which has resulted in breaking changes. REALM OPERATOR As the new Operator currently lacks some of the CRs (e.g. Client and User), we’re introducing a temporary workaround in the form of a Realm Operator. Please see its for more details. See also . SUPPORTED OPENJDK VERSIONS Keycloak now supports OpenJDK 17 both for the server and adapters. With the removal of the WildFly based distribution there is no longer support for running the Keycloak server on OpenJDK 8. We also plan to remove support for Keycloak adapters on OpenJDK 8 in Keycloak 21. Starting with Keycloak 22 we plan to only support the latest OpenJDK LTS release and aiming to quickly also support the latest OpenJDK release. That means we will be also removing OpenJDK 11 support for the Keycloak server in Keycloak 22. HOSTNAME PROVIDER NOW SUPPORTS CONFIGURING THE COMPLETE BASE URL In this release, we are introducing two additional server options to set the base URL for frontend request and the Admin Console: * hostname-url * hostname-admin-url More details can be found at the . IMPROVEMENTS TO KC.BAT WHEN RUNNING KEYCLOAK ON WINDOWS In this release, we are making important changes to kc.bat to give the same experience as when running on Linux. UPGRADE OF EMBEDDED H2 DATABASE Keycloak ships for development purposes with an H2 database driver. As it is intended for development purposes only, it should never be used in a production environment. In this release, the H2 driver has been upgraded from version 1.x to version 2.x. FEATURE GUARD FOR HOSTING THE KEYCLOAK JAVASCRIPT ADAPTER Applications are able to load keycloak.js directly from the Keycloak server. As it’s not considered a best-practice to load JavaScript libraries this way there is now a feature guard that allows disabling this ability. In Keycloak 21 we will deprecate this option, and in Keycloak 22 we plan to completely remove the ability to load keycloak.js from the Keycloak server. OTP APPLICATION SPI In previous releases the list of OTP applications displayed to users was hard-coded in Keycloak. With the introduction of the OTP Application SPI it is now possible to disable built-in OTP applications, as well as adding custom OTP Applications. CUSTOM IDENTITY PROVIDERS CAN NOW SET AN ICON FOR THE PROVIDER A custom identity provider can now set the icon used on the login pages. Thanks to , who happens also to maintain . FIPS 140-2 EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT There is now experimental support for deploying Keycloak into a FIPS 140-2 enabled environment. There will be a blog post with the details shortly after the release with the details how you can try it. Feedback is welcome! Thanks to , who contributed parts of this feature. Also, thanks to and for their initial prototype effort, which was used as an inspiration. SEARCH GROUPS BY ATTRIBUTE It is now possible to search groups by attribute through the Admin REST API. Thanks to for this contribution. VIEW GROUP MEMBERSHIP IN THE ACCOUNT CONSOLE It is now possible to allow users to view their group memberships in the account console. Thanks to for this contribution. DEPRECATED METHODS FROM DATA PROVIDERS AND MODELS WERE REMOVED Several deprecated methods were removed from data providers and models. If not done already, their usage needs to be replaced with the corresponding replacement documented in Javadoc of Keycloak 19 release. See for more details. MIGRATION FROM 19.0 Before you upgrade remember to backup your database. If you are not on the previous release refer to for a complete list of migration changes. RESTEASY VERSION UPDATE Updated the RESTEasy version of Keycloak Admin REST Client to the next major version. H2 VERSION UPDATE Keycloak ships for development purposes with an H2 database driver. As it is intended for development purposes only, it should never be used in a production environment. In this release, the H2 driver has been upgraded from version 1.x to version 2.x. This change might require changes to the H2 JDBC URL or migration of the H2 database files in an existing Keycloak setup. CHANGES TO THE H2 JDBC URL For Keycloak to run with its JPA legacy store with H2 version 2.x, the JDBC URL requires the attribute NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE. In a setup where H2 is initialized by Keycloak without extra parameters, Keycloak will append the attribute automatically. This is the default for development setups. If an H2 JDBC URL is provided on the command line or in a configuration file, and it already contains the NON_KEYWORDS= attribute in the JDBC URL, this attribute needs to be amended with the VALUE keyword. If the connection factory for the H2 database is initialized outside Keycloak, that initialization needs to take care of adding the NON_KEYWORDS attribute. See the H2 documentation for details. UPGRADE OF H2 DATABASE FILES H2 database base files created with H2 version 1.x should not be used with version 2.x. Purge existing H2 database files to start with an empty database, export and import the realms using Keycloak’s export and import functionality, or refer to the for details on how to migrate H2 database contents. BREAKING CHANGES IN THE NEW VERSION OF KEYCLOAK OPERATOR Note In order to use the newest version of the Keycloak Operator, the manual reinstallation and upgrade of your CRs are required. There’s no automated migration. This release contains the following breaking changes in Keycloak CRs: SERVERCONFIGURATION FREE-FORM FIELD WAS RENAMED From now on it’s called additionalOptions. The idea behind this decision is to align it more with the Keycloak Quarkus distribution and achieve/preserve a naming consistency. serverConfiguration can be still used for configuring options that haven’t got a declared alternative in Keycloak custom resources (CRs). A good example of such use can be service providers. INGRESS OPTIONS WERE REFINED In the past, it used to be defined via the disableDefaultIngress property. We decided to clarify it a bit, thus from now on you can use the following structure to control your ingress settings: spec: ... ingress: enabled: false HTTP OPTIONS WERE ADDED Similarly, like with ingress, you can define multiple HTTP options in a better structural manner: spec: ... http: httpEnabled: true httpPort: 80 httpsPort: 443 tlsSecret: my-tls-secret HOSTNAME OPTIONS WERE ADDED Last but not least, the hostname options were also changed: spec: ... hostname: hostname: [keycloak-server-hostname] admin: [admin-console-hostname] adminUrl: [admin-console-base-url] strict: [true|false] strictBackchannel: [true|false] SOME FIELDS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED The hostname and tlsSecret fields are now optional to align with the Quarkus distribution configuration. With that we also removed the possibility to set INSECURE-DISABLE special value to those fields. In order to disable hostname checks and enable HTTP, please follow the same approach as with the Quarkus distribution, i.e. set strict: false, strictBackchannel: false and httpEnabled: true fields. OLM CHANNEL WAS CHANGED TO FAST The default channel of Keycloak Operator Lifecycle Manager was changed to fast. DEPRECATED METHODS FROM DATA PROVIDERS AND MODELS WERE REMOVED Prior to Keycloak 15, there was a clean-up of provider and model interfaces where we deprecated some methods. Javadoc of these methods contained a corresponding replacement method (see Javadoc of Keycloak 19 release). In this release the methods were removed. The following is a list of all changed classes. The most common patterns for deprecating and removing the methods are the following. * Streamification - interfaces now contain only Stream-based methods. For example in interface @Deprecated List&lt;GroupModel&gt; getGroups(RealmModel realm); was replaced by Stream&lt;GroupModel&gt; getGroupsStream(RealmModel realm); More details on streamification work can be found in . * Consistent parameter ordering - methods now have strict parameter ordering where RealmModel is always the first parameter. For example in interface @Deprecated UserModel getUserById(String id, RealmModel realm); was replaced by UserModel getUserById(RealmModel realm, String id) LIST OF CHANGED INTERFACES (o.k. stands for org.keycloak. package) * server-spi module * o.k.credential.CredentialInputUpdater * o.k.credential.UserCredentialStore * o.k.models.ClientProvider * o.k.models.ClientSessionContext * o.k.models.GroupModel * o.k.models.GroupProvider * o.k.models.KeyManager * o.k.models.KeycloakSessionFactory * o.k.models.ProtocolMapperContainerModel * o.k.models.RealmModel * o.k.models.RealmProvider * o.k.models.RoleContainerModel * o.k.models.RoleMapperModel * o.k.models.RoleModel * o.k.models.RoleProvider * o.k.models.ScopeContainerModel * o.k.models.UserCredentialManager * o.k.models.UserModel * o.k.models.UserProvider * o.k.models.UserSessionProvider * o.k.models.utils.RoleUtils * o.k.sessions.AuthenticationSessionProvider * o.k.storage.client.ClientLookupProvider * o.k.storage.group.GroupLookupProvider * o.k.storage.user.UserLookupProvider * o.k.storage.user.UserQueryProvider * server-spi-private module * o.k.events.EventQuery * o.k.events.admin.AdminEventQuery * o.k.keys.KeyProvider All changes are linked to the following .

This article offers simple procedures for initializing and terminating applications using OpenSSL. Modern applications that are more complex than "Hello, world!" usually require several external libraries like OpenSSL, which in turn often need to be properly initialized on startup and deinitialized on shutdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL libraries are set up internally during program initialization. At this time, they load the configuration file, allocate resources, and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/05/31/your-go-application-fips-compliant"&gt;handle FIPS mode&lt;/a&gt;, among many other tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL API function for initialization is &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_init_crypto&lt;/code&gt;. This function &lt;a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/OPENSSL_init_crypto.html"&gt;accepts a variety of options&lt;/a&gt; with reasonable defaults. Initialization should be performed before any other OpenSSL function is used, though some OpenSSL functions invoke &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_init_crypto&lt;/code&gt; themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cleaning up in an atexit function&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you shut down your application, you need to free the resources you acquired. Because developers don't always code accurately, OpenSSL relies on a function provided by the C runtime library named &lt;a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html"&gt;atexit&lt;/a&gt;. This function specifies a cleanup function that will be executed upon normal termination of the application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; is useful for many purposes, so it is widely used. Even though most resources are freed on any program termination, it's always better to free them explicitly–for example, to prevent false positives from being turned up by &lt;a href="https://valgrind.org"&gt;Valgrind&lt;/a&gt; or similar tools searching for memory leaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem with &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; is that real-life applications use many different libraries, each of which might install its own cleanup function. Although the &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; man page declares that the registered functions are called in the reverse order of their registration, the real order of execution is not predictable in practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One obvious scenario where the order is undefined is a multithreaded setup. Various plugins and third-party libraries might have their own &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; handlers that can be loaded at runtime, which can be another possible source of problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executing cleanup functions in the wrong order can cause a crash on application shutdown. For example, an application might establish an SSL connection and create the corresponding objects. On shutdown, if the SSL object is deleted before the OpenSSL cleanup, everything is OK, but otherwise a crash will occur. This example is a real bug &lt;a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/2482"&gt;found recently&lt;/a&gt; by Nmap users. Originally reported for Solaris, it was later reproduced on a Fedora machine. If you find problems in a specific application or library, it's worth filing a bug in the hope that the problem will be fixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Problems with &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; handlers are reported to the upstream OpenSSL developers, Red Hat, and Fedora developers on a regular basis. There are several ways to solve the problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors of Nmap &lt;a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/commit/5f88cbac30c438587de6d01c13327f9b7316c94f"&gt;resolved&lt;/a&gt; the reported issue by using one more function from the OpenSSL API: &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_atexit&lt;/code&gt;. This function registers an application-specific handler, which is a suitable location for ensuring the order of resource deinitialization. The approach used in Nmap could cause a memory leak in some circumstances, but because it happens during shutdown, that isn't too much of a big deal. However, we don't recommend this option because memory leaks on shutdown make it more difficult to search for important runtime memory leaks. Using &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_atexit&lt;/code&gt; also makes code more complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recommended initialization and shutdown procedure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best option is a properly serialized deinitialization, during which the &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; hooks are executed in the correct order, all the application threads terminate except the main one, etc. This sequence requires you to be thorough in your coding, but it's worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your application has to shut down manually, OpenSSL authors suggest a procedure with two parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, the application should use the &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ATEXIT&lt;/code&gt; option in the &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_init_crypto&lt;/code&gt; call at OpenSSL initialization, to avoid implicit installation of the OpenSSL cleanup handler. After that, when the application terminates and no further OpenSSL functions will be called, invoke &lt;code&gt;OPENSSL_cleanup&lt;/code&gt; explicitly to free resources on shutdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a manual shutdown option is useful for some libraries, but a predictable order of initialization and deinitialization is preferable.&lt;/p&gt; The post &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/31/best-practices-application-shutdown-openssl" title="Best practices for application shutdown with OpenSSL"&gt;Best practices for application shutdown with OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog" title="Red Hat Developer"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary><dc:creator>Dmitry Belyavskiy</dc:creator><dc:date>2022-10-31T07:00:00Z</dc:date></entry><entry><title type="html">Grace Hopper Celebration Recap</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/ghc22-recap/" /><author><name>Farah Juma</name></author><id>https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/ghc22-recap/</id><updated>2022-10-31T00:00:00Z</updated><dc:creator>Farah Juma</dc:creator></entry><entry><title type="html">Announcing Dashbuilder VSCode extension</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/10/announcing-dashbuilder-vscode-extension.html" /><author><name>William Siqueira</name></author><id>https://blog.kie.org/2022/10/announcing-dashbuilder-vscode-extension.html</id><updated>2022-10-28T20:42:52Z</updated><content type="html">We are glad to announce that the Dashbuilder has been released! With this extension you can create dashboards using YAML files on local VS Code, VS Code Web (github.dev) and also published on marketplace. The extension can also be downloaded as part of . HOW TO CREATE DASHBOARDS WITH DASHBUILDER? Dashbuilder supports YAML and JSON dashboards definitions. To learn more about it you can check our , the from Dashbuilder website and an article from Manaswini Das about . To create dashboards you can use the or the new VSCode extension. DASHBUILDER EXTENSION VS CODE INSTALLATION To install dashbuilder editor on VS Code go to the “Extensions” and search for “dashbuilder”. Click on install and you should be able to edit dashboards using YAML (.dash.yaml) or JSON (.dash.json). Once installed, open a dashbuilder definition file with text editor and Dashbuilder editor should be opened on the side.  Dashbuilder extension is also available on VS Code web, you just have to install the extension. CONCLUSION In this post we announced the Dashbuilder VS Code extension. We hope to improve the editor for next releases with content assist, editor augmentation and more, so stay tuned!
