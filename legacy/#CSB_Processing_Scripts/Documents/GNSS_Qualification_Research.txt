Qualify GNSS on:


---Questions:
!- std is calculated using mean from all observations in the rinex file
!- is value of 1stdev or how many std away from mean?
A: it is difference/variation from mean at 95% confidence


CSRS-PPP:
- note stdev is calculated by taking the average of the entire rinex file

PPP_headers:
DIR - direction
FRAME - reference frame
STN - station?
DAYofYEAR - date
YEAR-MM-DD - date
HR:MN:SS.SS - time
NSV - navigation space vehicles (# sat in sky)
GDOP - geometrical dilution of precision (spread of sat in sky)
RMSC(m)
RMSP(m)
DLAT(m),DLON(m),DHGT(m) - lat, long, height in degree
CLK(ns) - clock
TZD(m) - total zenith delay
SDLAT(95%) - stdev latitude
SDLON(95%) - stdev longitude
SDHGT(95%) - stdev height
SDCLK(95%) - stdev clock
SDTZD(95%) - stdev total zenith delay
LATDD,LATMN,LATSS - latitude in d,m,s
LONDD,LONMN,LONSS - longitude in d,m,s
HGT(m) - height referenced to ellipsoid
UTMZONE
UTM_EASTING
UTM_NORTHING
UTM_SCLPNT
UTM_SCLCBN

GDOP - Geometrical Dilution of Precision
- how spread out the statelites are in the sky
- looks at (x,y,z,t) 3d+time
- DOP is a useful estimate of the likely accuracy and precision related to the satellite positions, this is not the only source of error as can be seen from the list above.

- slide 24 gives GDOP rating (2-3 is excellent)
- slide 30 gives calculating error
