Hi,

What is you looking for is possible with WebTide (although a non-standard use).
WebTide is basically a Java GUI on top of some C-code (tidecor). The tidecor can also be used directly.

If you want to run tidecor (or Tidecor.exe) from the terminal like that you need to have the correct set of input files.
You will need to create an input file that lists the points in this format.
lon            lat      year   dayofyear    hours    minutes    seconds
-153.868    58.004000    2014    310        00       00         00

Then you can run tidecor using this command,
tidecor.exe tidecor_velocity.cfg input.dat output.dat


For the cfg file you can download an example I created for the pacific grid.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fjzxnp09nwm6xq0/webtide_batch_jim.zip?dl=0 

You will have to create a new cfg file for which ever region you are using. 
This file tells tidecor which grid information to use as well as which constituents to use.


Let me know if you have any questions.

Mitchell

Hi,

That example was initially setup for velocity, so those values are u and v.

It works similarly for elevation. You can make a new cfg file and point it at the s2c files instead of the v2c files.
And when run it should yield a single number for elevation.

Let me know if you have any issues making it work.
If so I should be able to put together a cfg for the region you are working in.

Regards,
Mitchell

Running,
tidecor.exe tidecor_velocity.cfg input.dat output.dat
Should produce velocities.

Running,
tidecor.exe tidecor_elevation.cfg input.dat output.dat
Should produce elevations.

The *2c files are tidal constituents extracted from a model, I think the Webtide page has a reference for a paper.
They do not need to be updated for difference time periods. 

If you are unaware of tidal constituents you can download "the tidal bible" here,

Let me know if the above does not work for you.
